						*grep-overview*
1. Overview~

The grep plugin integrates the grep, fgrep, egrep, agrep, ag, ack and ripgrep
tools with Vim and allows you to search for a pattern in one or more files and
jump to them.

To use the this plugin with grep, you will need the grep, fgrep, egrep, agrep
utilities. To recursive search for files using grep, you will need the find
and xargs utilities. These tools are present in most of the Unix and MacOS
installations.  For MS-Windows systems, you can download the GNU grep and find
utilities from the following sites:

    http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/grep.htm
    http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/findutils.htm

If you want to use the Silver Searcher (ag) with this plugin, then you can
download the Silver Searcher from:

    https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher

If you want to use the ack utility with this plugin, then you can
download the ack utility from:

    https://beyondgrep.com/

If you want to use ripgrep (rg) with this plugin, then you can download the
ripgrep utility from:

    https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep

The silver searcher, ripgrep and ack utilities can search for a pattern
recursively across directories without using any other additional utilities
like find and xargs.

The github repository for this plugin is at http://github.com/yegappan/grep

						*grep-installation*
2. Installation~

1. Expand the grep.zip file to the $HOME/.vim/plugin or
   $HOME/vimfiles/plugin or $VIM/vimfiles/plugin directory.
2. If the grep executables are not already present in one of the directories
   in the PATH environment variable, then set the Grep_Path and other _Path
   variables to point to the location of the grep utilities in the .vimrc
   file.
3. Restart Vim.
4. You can now use the ":Grep" and other commands to search for patterns in
   files.

==============================================================================

The above commands can be invoked like this:

   :Grep   [<grep_options>] [<search_pattern> [<file_name(s)>]]
   :Rgrep  [<grep_options>] [<search_pattern> [<file_name(s)>]]
   :Fgrep  [<grep_options>] [<search_pattern> [<file_name(s)>]]
   :Rfgrep [<grep_options>] [<search_pattern> [<file_name(s)>]]
   :Egrep  [<grep_options>] [<search_pattern> [<file_name(s)>]]
   :Regrep [<grep_options>] [<search_pattern> [<file_name(s)>]]
   :Agrep  [<grep_options>] [<search_pattern> [<file_name(s)>]]
   :Ragrep [<grep_options>] [<search_pattern> [<file_name(s)>]]
   :Ag [<grep_options>] [<search_pattern> [<file_name(s)>]]
   :Ack [<grep_options>] [<search_pattern> [<file_name(s)>]]
   :Rg [<grep_options>] [<search_pattern> [<file_name(s)>]]

   :GrepAdd   [<grep_options>] [<search_pattern> [<file_name(s)>]]
   :RgrepAdd  [<grep_options>] [<search_pattern> [<file_name(s)>]]
   :FgrepAdd  [<grep_options>] [<search_pattern> [<file_name(s)>]]
   :RfgrepAdd [<grep_options>] [<search_pattern> [<file_name(s)>]]
   :EgrepAdd  [<grep_options>] [<search_pattern> [<file_name(s)>]]
   :RegrepAdd [<grep_options>] [<search_pattern> [<file_name(s)>]]
   :AgrepAdd  [<grep_options>] [<search_pattern> [<file_name(s)>]]
   :RagrepAdd [<grep_options>] [<search_pattern> [<file_name(s)>]]
   :AgAdd [<grep_options>] [<search_pattern> [<file_name(s)>]]
   :AckAdd [<grep_options>] [<search_pattern> [<file_name(s)>]]
   :RgAdd [<grep_options>] [<search_pattern> [<file_name(s)>]]

   :GrepBuffer [<grep_options>] [<search_pattern>]
   :Bgrep [<grep_options>] [<search_pattern>]
   :GrepArgs [<grep_options>] [<search_pattern>]

   :GrepBufferAdd [<grep_options>] [<search_pattern>]
   :BgrepAdd [<grep_options>] [<search_pattern>]
   :GrepArgsAdd [<grep_options>] [<search_pattern>]

In the above commands, all the arguments are optional.

You can specify grep options like -i (ignore case) or -w (search for a word)
to the above commands.  If the <grep_options> are not specified, then the
default grep options specified by the variable Grep_Default_Options is used.

You can specify the grep pattern to search as an argument to the above
commands.  If the <search_pattern> is not specified, then you will be prompted
to enter a search pattern. By default, the keyword under the cursor is
displayed for the search pattern prompt. You can accept the default or modify
it.

The search pattern is automatically enclosed by the escape character. You
should not enclose the search pattern with a shell escape character.

If you want to specify a search pattern with space characters or a multi-word
pattern, then you should run the Grep command without any arguments and use
the search pattern input prompt to supply the search pattern.

You can specify one or more file names (or file patterns) to the above
commands.  If the <file_names> are not specified, then you will be prompted to
enter file names.  By default, the pattern specified by the
Grep_Default_Filelist variable is used. To specify the file name(s) as an
argument to the above commands, you have to specify the search pattern also.

When you enter only the command name, you will be prompted to enter the search
pattern and the files in which to search for the pattern. By default, the
keyword under the cursor is displayed for the search pattern prompt.
Depending on the command, you may prompted for additional parameters like the
directories to search for the pattern.

You can retrieve previously entered values for the Grep prompts using the up
and down arrow keys. You can cancel the command by pressing the escape key.
You can use CTRL-U to erase the default shown for the prompt and CTRL-W to
erase the previous word in the prompt. For more information about editing the
prompt, read |:cmdline-editing| Vim help topic.

After invoking any of the grep commands, you can cancel the command, when you
are prompted for a search pattern or file names or a directory by pressing the
<Esc> key. If you are using a Vim version before 8.0, then you cannot cancel
(or kill) the grep/fgrep/egrep/agrep commands after the external command is
invoked.

If you are using Vim version 8.0 and above, then the grep commands are run
asynchronously in the background. The search output is parsed and the results
are added to the quickfix list in the background. Invoking a grep command will
cancel the current grep command which is running in the background (if any).

The GrepAdd, RgrepAdd and other *Add commands append the search output to the
current search output. This is useful if you want to see the search results
for multiple patterns at the same time. These commands are available only in
Vim version 7.0 and above.

Some examples for using the :Ag command to search for a pattern are below:
>
    " To search for 'myclass' recursively from the current directory
    :Ag myclass .
    " To search for 'myclass' only in .java files in the current directory
    :Ag myclass *.java
    " To search for 'myclass' only in .java files recursively
    :Ag --java myclass .
<
You can map a key to invoke any of the above commands. For example, the
following map invokes the :Grep command to search for the keyword under the
cursor:

      nnoremap <silent> <F3> :Grep<CR>

The output of the grep command will be listed in the Vim quickfix window.
1. You can select a line in the quickfix window and press <Enter> or double
   click on a match to jump to that line.
2. You can use the ":cnext" and ":cprev" commands to the jump to the next or
   previous output line.
3. You can use the ":colder" and ":cnewer" commands to go between multiple
   grep quickfix output windows.
4. The quickfix window need not be opened always to use the grep output.
   You can close the quickfix window and use the quickfix commands to jump
   to the grep matches.  Use the ":copen" command to open the quickfix
   window again.

For more information about other quickfix commands read ":help quickfix"

When using GUI Vim, the Tools->Search menu item with a few sub-menu items is
created for few variations of the search command.

Note that when recursively searching for a pattern using the silver searcher,
ripgrep or ack utilities, if a large number (several thousands) of matching
files are found, then it will take some time for Vim to load all the files
into the buffer list. In the meantime, Vim will be slow to respond or may not
respond to keystrokes.

						*grep-configuration*
4. Configuration~

By changing the following variables you can configure the behavior of this
plugin. Set the following variables in your .vimrc file using the |:let|
command.

The 'Grep_Path' variable is used to locate the grep utility. By default, this
is set to grep. You can change this using the let command:

      :let Grep_Path = 'C:\Progra~1\Grep\grep.exe'

The 'Fgrep_Path' variable is used to locate the fgrep utility. By default,
this is set to fgrep. You can change this using the let command:

      :let Fgrep_Path = 'C:\Progra~1\Grep\fgrep.exe'

The 'Egrep_Path' variable is used to locate the egrep utility. By default,
this is set to egrep. You can change this using the let command:

      :let Egrep_Path = 'C:\Progra~1\Grep\egrep.exe'

The 'Agrep_Path' variable is used to locate the agrep utility. By default,
this is set to agrep. You can change this using the let command:

      :let Agrep_Path = 'C:\Progra~1\Grep\agrep.exe'

The 'Ag_Path' variable is used to locate the ag (silver searcher) utility. By
default, this is set to ag. You can change this using the let command:

      :let Ag_Path = 'C:\Progra~1\Silver_Searcher\ag.exe'

The 'Ack_Path' variable is used to locate the ack utility. By default, this is
set to ack. You can change this using the let command:

      :let Ack_Path = 'C:\Progra~1\ack\ack.pl'

The 'Rg_Path' variable is used to locate the rg (ripgrep) utility. By default,
this is set to rg. You can change this using the let command:

      :let Rg_Path = 'C:\Progra~1\ripgrep\rg.exe'

The 'Grep_Find_Path' variable is used to locate the find utility. By default,
this is set to 'find'. Note that on MS-Windows, there is a find.exe that is
part of the base OS. This find utility is different from the Unix find
utility. You cannot use this utility with this plugin. You must install the
Unix compatible find utility and set the Grep_Find_Path variable to point to
the location of the utility. You can change this using the let command:

      :let Grep_Find_Path = 'C:\Progra~1\Grep\find.exe'

The 'Grep_Xargs_Path' variable is used to locate the xargs utility. By
default, this is set to xargs. You can change this using the let command:

      :let Grep_Xargs_Path = 'C:\Progra~1\Grep\xargs.exe'

When running any one of the Grep commands, you will be prompted for the files
in which to search for the pattern. The 'Grep_Default_Filelist' variable is
used to specify to default for this prompt. By default, this variable is set
to '*'. You can specify multiple matching patterns separated by spaces. You
can change this settings using the let command:

      :let Grep_Default_Filelist = '*.[chS]'
      :let Grep_Default_Filelist = '*.c *.cpp *.asm'

The 'Grep_Default_Options' is used to pass default command line options to the
grep/fgrep/egrep/agrep/ag/rg utilities. By default, this is set to an empty
string.  You can change this using the let command:

      :let Grep_Default_Options = '-i'

The 'Grep_Skip_Dirs' variable specifies the list of directories to skip while
doing recursive searches. By default, this is set to 'RCS CVS SCCS'.  You can
change this using the let command:

      :let Grep_Skip_Dirs = 'dir1 dir2 dir3'

The 'Grep_Skip_Files' variable specifies the list of files to skip while doing
recursive searches. By default, this is set to '*~ *,v s.*'. You can change
this using the let command:

      :let Grep_Skip_Files = '*.bak *~'

By default, when you invoke the Grep commands the quickfix window will be
opened with the grep output.  You can disable opening the quickfix window, by
setting the 'Grep_OpenQuickfixWindow' variable  to zero:

      :let Grep_OpenQuickfixWindow = 0

You can manually open the quickfix window using the :cwindow command.

By default, for recursive searches, the 'find' and 'xargs' utilities are used.
If you don't have the 'xargs' utility or don't want to use the 'xargs'
utility, " then you can set the 'Grep_Find_Use_Xargs' variable to zero. If
this is set to zero, then only the 'find' utility is used for recursive
searches:

      :let Grep_Find_Use_Xargs = 0

To handle file names with space characters in them, the xargs utility is
invoked with the '-0' argument. If the xargs utility in your system doesn't
accept the '-0' argument, then you can change the Grep_Xargs_Options variable.
For example, to use the '--null' xargs argument, you can use the following
command:

	:let Grep_Xargs_Options = '--null'

The Grep_Cygwin_Find variable should be set to 1, if you are using the find
utility from the cygwin package. This setting is used to handle the difference
between the backslash and forward slash path separators.

      :let Grep_Cygwin_Find = 1

The 'Grep_Null_Device' variable specifies the name of the null device to pass
to the grep commands. This is needed to force the grep commands to print the
name of the file in which a match is found, if only one filename is specified.
For Unix systems, this is set to /dev/null and for MS-Windows systems, this is
set to NUL. You can modify this by using the let command:

      :let Grep_Null_Device = '/dev/null'

The 'Grep_Shell_Escape_Char' variable specifies the escape character to use
for protecting special characters from being interpreted by the shell.  For
Unix systems, this is set to '\' and for MS-Window systems, this is set to an
empty string.  You can change this using the let command:

      :let Grep_Shell_Escape_Char = "'"

The 'Grep_Run_Async' variable specifies whether the grep commands are run
synchronously or asynchronously. Depending on the Vim version, this variable
is set automatically.  If you want to force Vim to run the grep commands
synchronously, then you can set the 'Grep_Run_Async' variable to 1.
